    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in Seoul, South Korea, with a birthday approximated to be in December of 2019. I adopted my human on
      March
      26, 2020
      and have taken care of her ever since! I was named after <a
        href="https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0041512">confucian scholars</a> of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon">Joseon Dynasty</a>. The story goes
      that when I was a student, I accidentally fell asleep while studying for my exams and woke up with this blotch
      of
      ink on my face that never went away &#40let's just call it a beauty mark&#41. </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Excluding past lives</h4>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fought away human loneliness by yowling nightly to help her feel my presence</li>
        <li>Cuddled professionally</li>
        <li>Successfully informed her males are scary by deftly running at the sign of any movement and hiding under
          the
          covers for the first 15 minutes to prove my point. Male visitors successfully became a rarity; adopted
          human's
          long-term partner is the only exception to the males-are-scary rule.</li>
        <li>Refused any soft, water-down food like the royalty I know I will be in my next life. I don't care
          if it was because I lost all of my teeth to gum disease. I want hard, delectable kibble--that 40,000&#8361;
          stuff
          that hurts my human's wallet!</li>
